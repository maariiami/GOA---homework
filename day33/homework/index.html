        <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nika11keshelava">Goal-Oriented Academy</a> - Studying in includes a good knowledge of the basics of all technologies relevant for the future. 
            ü§ùü§ù We prepare students to pass tech interviews in the future and to start a highly paid job at the initial stage of their career.
            ü§ùü§ù And the ultimate goal is to create & grow a business/startup to have an interesting and secure life (we teach all the necessary components and provide theoretical/practical knowledge)
            All children entering GOA become productive and are surrounded by successful people. They delete games from the computer and don't watch entertaining YouTubers anymore. Everyone becomes focused on success, enrichment and helping others. 
            üß† Age is not limited, admission to the course is done by interviewing the child and passing the registration exam.</p>
